## Rules and Action Syntax

## Offline Modes

Three modes for offline game are provided, including game mode, debug mode, and referee mode, in which game mode implements the basic function of Handsclapping game (multi-player is supported), while the debug mode provides more detailed information about the battle field and players which is nontransparent for players in game mode, such as each player's energy and health. The referee mode doesn't provide a consequtive battle environment, but judges the outcome of two actions, with no restriction on energy.
