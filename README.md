Handsclapping is a famous game in Chengdu No.7 Yucai Middle School. Some students who graduate from it, and other people who are interested in this game found this repository in order to develop an application for Handsclapping.

This is a new project and there're many things to do, in which the most esstential ones are listed below:

- Implement the basic element of offline Handsclapping, including energy, health, dodging, attack and other possible functions. It is also esstential to write a referee program for the game.
- Make the online version of this game, this may require the familiarity with the struecture of the Internet and some rendering technique.
- Build a practial AI model for this game which can play with human players and acts like a human player, or can even do better, beat the human in Handsclapping.
